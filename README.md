## Wave
This project is currently being migrated to being a web app due to issues with building/convenience for users.

Allows you to use either an audio file or YouTube video and slow it down. If using an audio file slowing down is done with pitch correction. You can run this project using:

```
yarn dev
```

Some have had to run:

```
node-scripts start 
electron start
```
